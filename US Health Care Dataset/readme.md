## Health Care Dataset Analysis and Dashboard

### Overview
This project involves analyzing a healthcare dataset to extract actionable insights related to patient demographics, billing, treatment trends, and medicine performance metrics. The analysis was performed using **MS Excel** with the goal of providing a comprehensive report and interactive dashboard summarizing key findings. The dashboard includes Pivot Tables and visualizations like bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to visually represent the results.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to explore the healthcare data, identify trends, and draw meaningful insights to help understand:
- Patient distribution based on demographics (age, gender).
- Average billing by medical condition.
- Time of admission's effect on billing and length of stay.

### Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values in key columns like "Patient ID", "Billing Amount", and "Medical Condition".
- Created new calculated columns:
  - **Age Group** (e.g., 0-20, 21-40) to categorize patient age.
  - **Length of Stay** calculated using admission and discharge dates.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We framed specific questions to guide the analysis, such as:
- What is the **average billing amount** for each medical condition?
- Which **age group** has the highest billing?
- What is the **total patient volume** across different hospitals and departments?

### 3. Pivot Table Creation
Pivot tables were created to summarize the data for answering the questions:
- **Average Billing by Medical Condition**: Displayed the average billing per condition.
- **Patient Volume by Age Group**: Visualized how different age groups contributed to patient volume.
- **Total Patients by Year**: Tracked patient admission trends over time.

### 4. Visualizations
To help convey the insights visually, we created several charts:
- **Bar Charts** for comparisons of billing amounts and patient volumes.
- **Line Charts** to show trends in patient admissions and treatment over years.
- **Pie Charts** for distribution of patient's admission types.

### Key Insights

### 1. **Average Billing by Condition**
   The average billing amount for various medical conditions was analyzed, revealing that complex conditions tend to have a significantly higher billing amount than common ones.

### 2. **Patient Distribution by Age**
   Patients in the age group of 55-70+ years had the highest average billing, likely due to more complex treatments associated with this age bracket.

### 3. **Insurance Providers Distribution**
   Analyzed percentage share of Insurance providers in providing Insurance, 'Cigna' having the highest.
   
### 4. **Stay Timing and Billing**
   Billing amounts varied depending on the length of staying, from time of admission, with higher billing for certain medical conditions.

### Conclusion
This project provides a thorough analysis of the healthcare data, with visual storytelling to highlight patterns in patient demographics, medicine performance, and billing trends. The interactive dashboard can be used by healthcare administrators to monitor key metrics and make data-driven decisions.
